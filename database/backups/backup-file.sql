I have recently published a book, Smart Textiles for Designers,  and have lectured all over the world on both smart textiles and the research I have done for NASA in wearables and the integration of technology into the objects we wear.   At Pratt, where I have been of the faculty in both the Fashion and Industrial design departments for over 15 years, I have created numerous classes around design, research and innovation including collaborations with Ubiquitous Computing at UNH, NYU-Poly\'s Interactive Engineering and Sensor Design at Stony Brook  as well as the co-taught Mars Transit Habitat Design with Pratt Architecture.\n \n In 2014, I founded Interwoven Design Group, an industrial design and innovation consulting practice specializing in wearable technology and smart textiles.  We develop products for clients and created installations for museums and galleries.  We split our work between research and consumer products and enjoy work that involves new materials, technology and the physical body.  As a designer and artist, I am concerned with both aesthetics and the human condition, at Interwoven our work raises questions about the future and  the boundaries of communication through fashion, design and technology. \n \n Since starting Interwoven, we have received a commission to create a work for the My Shirt is Breathing show at the Biet Ha\'ir Museum in Tel Aviv Israel in 2015 and currently have work on tour with the Coded Couture show currently at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery in NYC.  We are in the midst of working on a smart textile installation, ICEBERG,  exploring how e-textiles and fiber based technologies can be crafted to provoke thought bringing awareness to an individual\'s exposed data.\n \n Interwoven would be an asset to New Lab as a smart textile and wearables expert.','','','1.

We are currently producing prototypes for VENA water\'s technology in our incubator space in California because we don\'t have access to prototyping equipment in New York, but would like to keep our creative capital localized.  \n \n About VENA: VENA\'s AWG has the smallest carbon footprint of any water deliverance technology on the market. VENA\'s AWG eliminates the use of energy intensive condensing mechanisms found in conventional AWG technologies. By eliminating moving parts, mechanical mechanisms and energy intensive refrigerants to generate water, our AWG requires minimal maintenance and operational costs. By providing low energy, local and sustainable water to water scarce regions, our AWG is the least expensive AWG on the market today. Once each unit is constructed, VENA\'s AWG will produce water through the system\'s lifespan.\n \n VENA\'s AWG architecture is designed to minimize materials and construction while optimizing performance and cost. Our system\'s architecture is design to be able to be constructed with local materials and equipment. We use commercially off the shelf products (COTS) to comprise each system component. Through remote satellite sensors and monitoring technology, VENA is able to measure continuous performance, advising local maintenance personnel on effective maintenance practices to ensure optimal functionality. However VENA\'s passive AWG design contains no moving parts, mechanical mechanisms or harmful refrigerants, requiring minimal maintenance and cost to local communities.','','','I\'m most interested in access to prototyping equipment.

ARGO Labs is a nascent UrbanTech R&D organization pioneering a civic data science through an integrative framework of Device, Data & Decision-making. Our mission is to partner with city agencies to co-create scalable citywide solutions through rapid prototyping.  We believe that embracing such an approach would yield in unlocking many digital solutions for NYC and beyond. ARGO Labs, in the flesh,  is Varun Adibhatla and Graham Henke who are recent graduates of NYU\'s Center for Urban Science and Progress, (Class of 2015) along with a coalition of like-minded Urban informatics practitioners and current CUSP students.\n \n Our flagship project, Street Quality Identification Device (SQUID) is a low-cost sensor platform to perform autonomous street surveys using a GPS, accelerometer, and camera to provide a visual ground truth to street inspections and optimize resource allocation. Today, NYC spends upto $300 million a year on maintaining its streets and is liable to hundreds of millions of $$ in settling tort claims from defective roadways. The city relies on 311 complaints and manual techniques to react to degrading streets. SQUID empowers the city to be proactive about street maintenance in a way that was not possible before.\n \n Even a 1% optimization to street resurfacing decision making would more than pay for SQUID and result in a cost savings from data-driven & preventative maintenance. SQUID\'s mantra is that in order to connect the dots, you have to first collect the dots.  SQUID was a finalist at NYC Big Apps, 2015 and a recipient of a Knight prototype grant.\n \n With the emergence of LinkNYC - we are confident that we are well suited for the emerging urban tech environment to solve intractable city problems using device, data and decision-making and would fit right in with with NewLab\'s mission, resources and contribute to its community.','','','Do we need to have  a business plan to strengthen our application ?

But so far, collaboration platforms have struggled to deliver on expectations because they exist inside a collaboration paradox — employees typically need to invest their own time to gain the benefit of the tool, but they are reluctant to invest the time without an immediate benefit.\"\n\nHierarchy aside, employees are usually organized in teams that will set out to solve problems to help the business. More often than not, some teams will solve problems that other teams had already solved in the past. Worse, some teams will barely communicate with adjacent teams with which they could otherwise discuss and develop breakthrough ideas. Generally, big companies have always generated silos and by breaking those silos companies can truly spark innovation potential.\n\nSmart Canvas allows teams to curate content for themselves, but will promote general-interest interactions and cross-pollination of ideas and discussions among teams inside the organization. The product will also use gamification and machine learning to identify relevant topics and automatically connect people looking for answers to other people who seem to be experts. Machine learning is also at the core of a \"nudge engine\" that keeps reminding people of the collaboration potential inside the company.\n \nWe got inspired by the simplicity of the \"online music\" apps, which have the incredibly hard goal to organize a huge database of content and tastes. The intersection of people and machine learning showed already to be a winner for the music industry and that has been our approach since we started to build Smart Canvas.','','','We are currently using WeWork downtown. We like it and we try to get the most our of it. As they say, “innovation happens in the space between” and we know that having the opportunity to bump up against others working to break down barriers and disrupt old ways of working will have an exponential impact on our product.\n\nWe believe that being in a truly multi-disciplinary environment like NewLab will help us to develop our product faster - not incrementally but by leaps and bounds. We also would love to power the platform that everyone in the lab could use to collaborate. This would be our biggest contribution to the NewLab environment - providing the canvas by which others more effectively work together. \n\nSmart Canvas is a future spin-off of CI&T (ciandt.com), a company born in Brazil, now with 2000 employees globally, and for two consecutive years, named by Google as Partner of the Year for Cloud Platform.

I strive to collaborate on compelling, innovative design projects related to energy, food, and water systems, as well as storm preparedness and resiliency. For my undergraduate thesis, \"Locavoracious,\" I researched urban agriculture and aquaponics to propose a new paradigm for \"live-grow\" building envelopes in Stuyvesant Town, NYC. \nI am an avid model builder and having worked as a monitor and TA at the CMU SoArch wood shop for 3 years, I am confident in the creative use and teaching as well as the technical maintenance and repair of shop equipment. In addition, I participated in a number of courses and an advanced design studio, which focussed on the application of an array of machinery in CMU’s extensive digital fabrication lab. I have proficient knowledge of laser cutters, 3D printers and CNC mills and also have experience with 6-axis robots in conjunction with industry standard Mastercam software for advanced CNC toolpathing and RobotStudio for ABB robotics.

Geotherapy embraces the future by addressing the link between our cultural and biological evolution.  I am a multi-disciplinary science based green product designer, installation artist, and educator combining advanced digital technology, bioinformatics product design and art.  In addition, I am an ardent environmentalist and have been putting together cross disciplinary think tanks for the past ten years which introduce technologists for environmental solutions to NGO’s, investors and governmental organizations. \n\nI am currently producing three bodies of work which all address the concept of ‘Geotherapy’ on a material level.  The first body of work is a green product line utilizing recycled materials and transforming them into objects for citywide use which will both functional and beautiful. The second body of work is restorative comprised of structures for living aquatic life which does not use plastic or concrete created to be reabsorbed by the environment they are biodegradable, non-toxic, act as bio-remediation filters, create habitat, and provide coastline protection. The third body of work is art-awareness installations which translate microscopic data from bioinformatics into large-scale figurative forms often using computer generated milling.  This body of work depicts the human impact on our delicate microscopic world.  These awareness works sequester toxins like plastic and uranium infused glass, and are meant for museums, galleries and public institutions. The final intention of all my work is to create awareness of the beneficial impact of ‘Geotherapy’ on our planet.\n\n*Note: The word ‘Geotherapy’ was coined by a panel of scientists at the Universite Claude Bernard in 1991 lead by Dr. Richard Grantham and Dr. Van Rensselaer Potter in Lyon, France to address the need to establish a global bioethic in the face of human induced climate change.  link to original ‘Geotherapy Declaration’: http://www.calamara.com/geotherapy-declaration/','','','I have always been drawn to the rich community of creative thinkers and the amazing array of businesses that the Navy Yard offers.

In that time I worked for a variety of leading companies and artists in design, fabrication, fine art, etc.  One of the most interesting jobs was working for New York Aquarium in their fiberglass shop. More of a laboratory than a production shop I got to learn how to use composites which at the time was almost a \"black art\" as information about composite fabrication was almost impossible to find.  After leaving there I continued to study and make things from composites.  Eventually I moved into the realm of \"advanced composites\" like carbon fiber, Kevlar, and hybrid materials and their unique manufacturing processes.\n\nCurrently,  I am solely focused on building a design / fabrication /manufacturing, entrepreneurial business around the use of carbon fiber and these other advanced materials.  The processes I use are very clean, environmentally friendly, and state of the art in material science.

Our controlled fermentation platform enables to improve the protein content of plant based foods; make healthier and tastier food by \"chewing away\" or enriching in specific molecules thanks to our synthetic microbial communities.','Afineur is using synthetic ecology to assemble designer fermentations to unlock some of the hidden potentials of plant-based foods.\r\n\r\nDesigner fermentations: Fermented foods have relied on natural spontaneous fermentations. We developed a platform enabling the use of tailored fermentations as a precision tool to enhance the chemistry of food, which opens a new realm of possibilities to naturally craft healthier, tastier, and more sustainable food.\r\n\r\nThe Cultured Foods that we produce are all natural, sterile, and no change in consumer behavior is required compared to their non-cultured versions. \r\n\r\nWhat we’re building here is a technology platform that can do much more (quicker, better, cheaper) than plant breeding, plant genetic engineering, food artificial flavoring and chemicals. Other substitutes include unsustainably growing more crops and raising more cattle to feed a world under intense increasing demographic pressure. \r\n','It’s the combination of unique expertise and passion of the two french founders, Camille and Sophie, who have been friends for over 10 years: awesome sustainable food and biotechnology. \r\n\r\nWe are both engineers by training and have PhDs from major universities (Camille - Harvard/Paris Universities in Synthetic Biology / Sophie - AgroParisTech in food engineering and chemistry). We both published in major international peer reviewed publications (including Science and Nature Protocols) and both have many years of experience in the industry. \r\n\r\nThe world needs a food revolution to feed ten billion people by 2050. There is an increasing need for better plant-based food and less land and environmental pressure.
